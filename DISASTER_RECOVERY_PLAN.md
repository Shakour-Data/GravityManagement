# GravityPM Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the GravityPM application, ensuring business continuity and data integrity in case of system failures, data loss, or catastrophic events.

## Recovery Objectives
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours for critical systems, 24 hours for full recovery
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum 1 hour of data loss
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**: 2 hours for database, 4 hours for full application

## Recovery Strategies

### 1. Database Recovery
#### Primary Strategy: Point-in-Time Recovery
- Use MongoDB's oplog for point-in-time recovery
- Maintain offsite backups with 30-day retention
- Use replica sets for automatic failover

#### Steps:
1. Stop the application services
2. Restore from the latest backup
3. Apply oplog operations to reach the desired point in time
4. Verify data integrity
5. Restart application services

### 2. Application Recovery
#### Container-Based Recovery
- Use Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Maintain container images in registry
- Use orchestration (Docker Compose/Kubernetes)

#### Steps:
1. Pull latest stable container images
2. Deploy using docker-compose
3. Restore configuration files
4. Verify application health
5. Update DNS/load balancer

### 3. Infrastructure Recovery
#### Cloud-Based Recovery
- Use AWS/GCP/Azure for infrastructure
- Implement multi-region deployment
- Use load balancers for traffic distribution

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
- **Frequency**: Daily full backups, hourly incremental
- **Retention**: 30 days for daily, 7 days for hourly
- **Storage**: Local + Cloud (AWS S3/GCP Cloud Storage)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all backups

### Backup Components
1. **Database**: MongoDB dumps with oplog
2. **Application Files**: Source code, configurations
3. **User Data**: Uploaded files, attachments
4. **System Configuration**: Nginx, systemd services

## Incident Response

### Detection and Assessment
1. Monitor system health using Prometheus/Grafana
2. Set up alerts for critical failures
3. Maintain incident response team contact list

### Recovery Procedures

#### Minor Incident (Single Service Failure)
1. Identify failed component
2. Restart service using Docker
3. Verify functionality
4. Update monitoring dashboard

#### Major Incident (System-wide Failure)
1. Assess damage and data loss
2. Activate backup recovery procedures
3. Restore from latest backup
4. Test application functionality
5. Communicate with stakeholders

#### Catastrophic Failure (Data Center Loss)
1. Activate secondary data center
2. Restore from geo-redundant backups
3. Update DNS to point to recovery site
4. Verify all systems operational
5. Perform thorough testing

## Testing and Maintenance

### Regular Testing
- **Monthly**: Test backup restoration
- **Quarterly**: Full disaster recovery simulation
- **Annually**: Review and update recovery procedures

### Maintenance Tasks
- Verify backup integrity weekly
- Update recovery documentation quarterly
- Test failover procedures monthly
- Review and update contact lists quarterly

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- Incident response team: Immediate notification
- Development team: Technical updates
- Management: Status reports every 2 hours

### External Communication
- Customers: Status page updates
- Stakeholders: Email notifications for major incidents
- Media: Prepared statements for catastrophic events
