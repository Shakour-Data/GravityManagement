# TODO: Complete Unfinished Activities from TODO_Fin.md

## Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
- [x] Implement database monitoring and alerting (added MongoDB exporter, enabled in prometheus.yml, added alerts)
- [x] Set up read replicas for performance (MongoDB replica set already configured in docker-compose.prod.yml)
- [x] Configure Redis clustering for high availability (added Redis cluster nodes to docker-compose.prod.yml)
- [x] Set up Redis monitoring and metrics (redis-exporter already in docker-compose.prod.yml)
- [x] Test deployment scripts (ran setup_and_run.sh and validated backend, frontend, MongoDB, Redis startup)

## Phase 2: Core Deployment (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment (update docker-compose.staging.yml, run deployment)
- [ ] Run full test suite (execute backend and frontend tests, generate reports)
- [ ] Validate all core functionality (manual testing of auth, projects, tasks)
- [ ] Set up basic backup procedures (enhance backup.sh for automated daily backups)

## Phase 3: Production Ready (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Final security audit (review WAF, encryption, MFA setup)
- [ ] Performance validation (run performance tests)
- [ ] Documentation updates (update TODO_Fin.md, create runbooks)
- [ ] Production deployment preparation (configure production docker-compose)

## Additional High-Priority Tasks
- [ ] Configure DDoS protection (update nginx-waf.conf)
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest (update database.py, add encryption service)
- [ ] Set up automated daily backups (update backup.sh)
- [ ] Set up staging environment (create docker-compose.staging.yml)
- [ ] Test all docker-compose configurations locally (run and validate each)
