# GravityPM Development Plan

## Information Gathered
- GravityPM is a project management software with a multi-layer architecture:
  - Presentation Layer (Web UI, Dashboard, Admin Panel)
  - Business Logic Layer (Project, Task, Resource Management, Rule Engine, Event Processor)
  - Supporting Services (Authentication, Notifications, File Service, GitHub Integration)
  - Data Layer (JSON files for data storage, caching, file storage)
- Uses JSON files instead of a traditional database for simplicity and portability.
- Integrates tightly with GitHub via webhooks and API for automation.
- Implements layered security including authentication, authorization, encryption.
- Performance optimizations include caching, lazy loading, and parallel rule evaluation.
- Testing strategy includes unit, integration, performance, and acceptance tests.
- CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.

## Plan

### Data Layer
- Implement JSON file management with locking, validation, backup.
- Implement caching layer with expiration and synchronization.
- Define data models for projects, WBS, activities, resources, rules, config.

### Business Logic Layer
- Implement services for project, task, resource management.
- Implement rule engine to process GitHub and system events.
- Implement event processor to execute actions based on rules.

### Presentation Layer
- Develop web UI components for dashboard, project/task/resource management.
- Implement navigation, notifications, and configuration UI.

### Supporting Services
- Implement authentication service with JWT and OAuth GitHub login.
- Implement notification service for internal, email, GitHub issues.
- Implement file service for upload/download with validation and encryption.
- Implement GitHub integration service for webhook handling and API calls.

### Security
- Implement layered security: authentication, authorization, encryption.
- Implement role-based access control.
- Secure sensitive data with encryption and secure communication.

### Performance and Scalability
- Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling.
- Optimize file read/write and rule processing.
- Implement monitoring and alerting.

### Testing and Deployment
- Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Prepare staging and production environments.

## Dependent Files to be Edited/Created
- JSON data files: project.json, rules.json, config.json
- Backend service files for business logic and services
- Frontend UI components and pages
- Security modules for auth and encryption
- CI/CD configuration files

## Follow-up Steps
- Confirm detailed requirements for each module.
- Setup development environment and project structure.
- Begin implementation in prioritized order (data layer, business logic, UI).
- Regularly test and validate each component.
- Integrate and test GitHub webhook and API integration.
- Deploy to staging and production environments.

Please confirm if you approve this plan or if you want me to adjust or add anything.
