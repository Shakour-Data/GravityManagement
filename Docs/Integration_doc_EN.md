## Introduction

This document describes the integration of GravityPM project management software with GitHub as the sole external system. GravityPM is a comprehensive project management system fully integrated with GitHub, using it as the primary source for automating project management processes. The main goal of this integration is to create an intelligent bidirectional connection between GravityPM and GitHub to enable full automation of project management processes based on GitHub events.

### Importance of GitHub Integration
