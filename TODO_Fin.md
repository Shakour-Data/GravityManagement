- **Low Risk**: Missing advanced features (can be added post-delivery)

## Dependencies
- Cloud provider access and credentials
- Domain and SSL certificates
- Third-party service configurations (monitoring, etc.)
- Team availability for final validation
- **GitHub Repository Secrets Setup**: DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD, SLACK_WEBHOOK (for CI/CD pipeline)
